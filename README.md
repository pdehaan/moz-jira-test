# jira-test

Mostly borrowed from https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-search/#api-rest-api-3-search-post example.

Visit https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/ to generate an API token and then do some <kbd>cp .env-dist .env</kbd> and fill in your `JIRA_TOKEN` and `JIRA_EMAIL` which generated said token and this should hopefully do something.
